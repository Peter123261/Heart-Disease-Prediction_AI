 AI-Powered Heart Disease Risk Detection for Smarter Healthcare Decisions ðŸ«€ðŸ“Š
        
        Heart Disease Prediction Model ðŸ©ºðŸš€
        A complete machine learning pipeline that predicts the risk of heart disease using clinical data, achieving over **91% accuracy.
        "The model is trained and evaluated using multiple classifiers with advanced hyperparameter tuning and supports deployment via Flask or Streamlit.\n\n"
        
        "## ðŸ“š Project Overview\n"
        "- **Problem**: Predict heart disease presence using structured medical features.\n"
        "- **Solution**: Built and evaluated multiple ML models using Grid Search and Random Search. Best-performing model achieved high accuracy and F1-score.\n"
        "- **Dataset**: Processed from Hungarian heart disease dataset (14 clinical features).\n"
        "- **Deployment Ready**: Includes Flask API and Streamlit app for real-time prediction.\n\n"
